### Overview
"Galaxy Guesser" is an engaging twist on the classic hangman game, offering users an opportunity to explore space-themed vocabulary. The game presents players with various levels of difficulty, each introducing new space-related words to learn. At the start, a spaceship with a full battery, indicated by a green bar, is displayed. As users make guesses and potentially make mistakes, the battery level decreases accordingly, with the color of the spaceship changing to yellow and then red as the battery depletes. This interactive experience combines gaming fun with educational value, making it an enjoyable way to expand one's knowledge of space terminology.
